                            Throughout this time, I had the opportunity to colaborate with some companies in order to create, update and maintain websites, landing pages, email templates and more. These is a quick overview of my professional career and how it's made up until now.

                                        Here I had my first job as a Web Designer, working along with a multidisciplinary team of marketers, programmers, designers and more. This was the place where I create my first wireframes to then coding their websites using tools like Wordpress, page builders and more.

                                        Working here I was able to continue my professional growth since I had the chance to colaborate with a multidisciplinary team, including designers, marketers and programmers to deliver best-quality products to the clients.

                                        One of the most important achievements I had here was getting confident with my English. We met everyday to talk about our tasks, almost every day with non-spanish speakers. Due to this, my English improved considerably.
